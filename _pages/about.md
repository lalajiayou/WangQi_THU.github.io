I am currently a Postdoc at Department of Applied Mathematics, _**The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)**_, working with Prof. [Defeng Sun, (SIAM Fellow)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/prof-sun-defeng/). I received my PhD degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering at _**Tsinghua University**_ in 2024, advised by Prof. [Wenchuan Wu (IEEE Fellow)](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/wuwench.htm).

My research is primarily focused on _**efficient distributed optimization algorithms**_ and _**their applications in coordinated optimization for hierarchical electrical power grids with integration of large-scale renewable generation**_. In this regard, I have conducted multiple studies to address the large-scale, non-convex, mixed-integer, spatio-temporal coupling optimization problems considering imperfect communication. These achievements also led to some awards, such as being nominated as a finalist (Top 1%) in the [Ph.D. Dissertation Challenge of IEEE I&CPS Asia 2023](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/mvwTmfKwyclKz9_x-txZdg).
